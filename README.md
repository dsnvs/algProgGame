# algProgGame

#### This game is a college project for the Algorithms and Programming class taught by Mariana Recamonde Mendoza in the first semester of 2017.

## About the game

The game is essentially Sokoban but without the final position of the blocks being visible to the player, so you'll have to find out where to place the block.

## What I used

 I used the functions of the C standard library to make most of the functionalities but also used **[ncurses.h](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/)** to interact with the screen.
